**Project Name:** ElevateWorkforceSolutionsJobPortal

**Programming Language:** JavaScript

**Frontend Framework:** React

**Backend Framework:** FastAPI (python)

**Database:** PostgreSQL (Consider other options like MongoDB or SQLite if needed for Replit compatibility)

**API Style:** RESTful

**Architecture:** MVC (Model-View-Controller) -  React components will act as Views, Express routes/controllers will handle logic, and models will interact with the database.

**Key Features (Minimum Viable Product):**

1.  **User Authentication:**
    * Endpoints: `/register`, `/login`, `/logout`
    * Method: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
    * Functionality: User registration, login, and secure session management.

2.  **Job Listings:**
    * Endpoints: `/jobs`, `/jobs/{id}`, `/jobs/search`
    * Methods: GET (for retrieving listings), POST (for creating listings - admin only)
    * Functionality: Display job listings, retrieve details of a specific job, search jobs by keywords (title, description, location).

3.  **Job Applications:**
    * Endpoints: `/applications`, `/applications/{job_id}`
    * Methods: POST (for submitting applications)
    * Functionality: Submit a job application (requires authentication).

**MVC Structure (Simplified for JavaScript):**

* **Models (Backend - Express):** Define database models using an ORM like Sequelize or TypeORM (or a simpler approach for Replit).
* **Controllers (Backend - Express):** Handle API requests, interact with models, and return responses.
* **Views (Frontend - React):** Create React components to structure the user interface and interact with the backend API.

**Database Schema (Example - Adapt as needed):**

* **Users:** `id (PK), username, password_hash, email, role (e.g., 'user', 'admin')`
* **Jobs:** `id (PK), title, description, location, category, company, posted_date`
* **Applications:** `id (PK), user_id (FK), job_id (FK), resume_path, cover_letter`

**Steps for Replit AI Agent (Concise):**

1.  Create a new React project (using `create-react-app` or similar).
2.  Create a new Express.js project.
3.  Set up PostgreSQL (or chosen database) in Replit.
4.  Implement database models using Sequelize (or appropriate ORM).
5.  Build API endpoints in Express for authentication, job listings, and applications.
6.  Create React components for the frontend.
7.  Connect React frontend to Express backend API.
8.  Implement JWT authentication.
9.  Add basic styling with CSS.
