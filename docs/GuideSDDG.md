<think>
I need to recreate the entire software design document in Overleaf format (LaTeX) and include UML diagrams in PlantUML format. Let me approach this systematically:

1. Create a full LaTeX document structure appropriate for a software design document
2. Convert the content from the previous document to LaTeX format
3. Create PlantUML code for:
   - High-level architecture diagram
   - Component diagram
   - Entity relationship diagram 
   - Class diagrams where appropriate

For the LaTeX structure, I'll need:
- Title page
- Table of contents
- Sections and subsections
- Tables for the risk analysis
- Bibliography handling for the references

Let me work on this one piece at a time.

\section{Problem Definition Statement}

\subsection{Business Problem}
The current job market faces significant inefficiencies in connecting qualified candidates with appropriate employment opportunities. Organizations struggle with lengthy recruitment processes, while job seekers encounter difficulties finding positions that match their skills and career aspirations. Traditional recruitment methods often result in:

\begin{itemize}
    \item High recruitment costs and time-to-hire metrics
    \item Mismatches between candidate skills and job requirements
    \item Limited geographic reach for both employers and job seekers
    \item Inconsistent application tracking and management
    \item Lack of transparency in the hiring process
\end{itemize}

Our Job Portal Application aims to address these challenges by creating a streamlined platform that facilitates efficient connections between employers and job seekers.

\subsection{Proposed Solution}
The Job Portal Application will provide a comprehensive platform that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Enables employers to post, manage, and track job listings
    \item Allows job seekers to search, filter, and apply for positions
    \item Facilitates the entire application process from submission to review

\caption{High-Level Architecture Diagram}
\label{fig:high-level-architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Backend Architecture}

The backend is structured using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Controller Layer}: API endpoints handling HTTP requests
    \item \textbf{Service Layer}: Business logic implementation
    \item \textbf{Data Access Layer}: Database interactions
    \item \textbf{Model Layer}: Data structures and validation
\end{itemize}

Key design patterns include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Repository pattern for data access
    \item Dependency injection for component coupling
    \item Strategy pattern for variable behaviors
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

This Software Design Document provides a comprehensive roadmap for the development of the Job Portal Application. By addressing the identified business problem through a structured approach to software development, we anticipate creating a solution that significantly improves the job search and recruitment processes for all stakeholders.

The architecture, tools, and methodologies outlined in this document have been carefully selected to ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable application. Ongoing evaluation and refinement of these choices will continue throughout the development lifecycle to adapt to emerging requirements and challenges.

## How to Use These Files in Overleaf

1. Create a new project in Overleaf
2. Upload the `main.tex` and `references.bib` files
3. Use the PlantUML code to generate diagrams (you can use the PlantUML online server at https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/ or local tools to generate PNG files)
4. Upload the generated PNG diagram files with the correct filenames referenced in the LaTeX document:
   - high_level_architecture.png
   - backend_architecture.png
   - frontend_architecture.png
   - database_design.png
5. Compile the document in Overleaf to generate your complete Software Design Document

This LaTeX document includes all the content from the previous document but formatted for Overleaf, with proper citation handling and placeholders for the UML diagrams.
